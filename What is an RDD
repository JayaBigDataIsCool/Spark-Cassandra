Dataset - Dataset contains primitive values, records, class objects, tuples
Distributed - Data may reside on different nodes in a cluster
Resilent - Data is recomputed based on lineage in case of failure
Immutable - Dataset is transformed into a new dataset rather than mutated
In-Memory - Data and computation is kept in memory as much as possible

We can only create or destroy an RDD but not modify it. This is the key because it simplifies the entire development. 
Always we transform an RDD to create a new RDD. It will not affect the Original RDD
